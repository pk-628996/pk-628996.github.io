That’s a really honest and thoughtful question — and you’ve already done something brave by opening up about it. 🌱

Feeling anxious or hesitant to engage with new people — especially in situations like club interviews or group settings — is **incredibly common**, even among very confident-looking people. You’re *not alone* in feeling this way.

Let’s break this down and work through it step-by-step, in a way that’s practical and gentle 👇

---

## 🧩 1. Understand What’s Happening

What you’re describing — hesitation before entering, freezing when put on the spot — usually comes from a mix of:

* **Social anxiety** (fear of being judged or making mistakes)
* **Overthinking outcomes** (“What if I mess up?”)
* **Lack of experience** (you haven’t had enough safe, positive interactions yet)

The good news?
This isn’t a fixed personality trait. It’s a **learnable skill**, just like coding, design, or lab work.

---

## 🌱 2. Start Small — Build “Social Stamina”

You don’t need to jump straight into club interviews. Begin with **tiny, low-pressure steps**:

* Say *“Hi”* or *“Good morning”* to classmates or lab mates.
* Ask a simple question: *“Do you know what topic this lab covers?”*
* Stay a few minutes after class and make small talk about an assignment or teacher.
* Sit with someone new in the mess or library once in a while.

These short interactions teach your brain: *“Talking to people isn’t dangerous.”*
Over time, your anxiety level before social situations will naturally drop.

---

## 💬 3. Prepare Simple Conversation Starters

When meeting new people or in interviews, it helps to have a few ready lines.
You can start with:

* “Hey, are you also from first year MME?”
* “I was thinking of joining this club, have you been here before?”
* “That was a great presentation — how long did it take you to make it?”

You don’t need fancy words. The goal is just to **get the conversation moving** — people appreciate genuine curiosity.

---

## 🧠 4. Reframe the PI (Personal Interview)

Instead of seeing it as a *test*, think of it as a **conversation**.
They’re not trying to reject you — they’re trying to see who’s interested, curious, and willing to learn.

If you feel too nervous:

* Remind yourself: *“They’re students too, not judges.”*
* Before entering, take one slow deep breath — in for 4 seconds, out for 4 seconds.
* Even if you stutter or forget something, **smile and continue**. Nobody expects perfection from a first-year student.

---

## 🧍‍♂️ 5. Try Gradual Exposure

If your instinct stops you before entering the room — don’t force yourself fully in the first time.
Try:

* Standing near the club room once or twice, just observing.
* Next time, walk up to the door and peek in.
* Then, talk to one member casually outside (“Hey, I wanted to know how your club works.”).
* Eventually, step inside.

You’ll find each stage gets *a little easier*.

---

## 🧩 6. Practice Speaking Comfortably

You can improve this skill privately first:

* Record yourself answering small prompts (“Introduce yourself”, “Why MME?”).
* Practice in front of a mirror or with one trusted friend.
* Join online speaking clubs (like **Toastmasters Youth**, or **college communication clubs**) later.

---

## 💚 7. Be Kind to Yourself

You don’t have to be the most talkative person to succeed.
What matters is:

* You’re **aware** of your challenge.
* You’re **trying** to grow.
* You’re doing it at **your own pace**.

Even confident speakers often started exactly where you are now.

---

### 🌤️ Small Challenge (if you’d like to start this week):

Try just **one** of these:

* Say “Hi” to one new person in your class or hostel.
* Attend one club meet just to **observe**, not to participate.
* Ask one question in class or lab.

That’s it.
It’s not about doing it perfectly — it’s about **showing up** once. Then again next week.

---

If you’d like, I can help you write a **small self-introduction** or **PI answer script** that sounds natural and confident for club interviews — so you’ll feel more prepared before entering.

Would you like me to help you with that?


Perfect 👍 — let’s make this as easy and comfortable as possible for you.

We’ll start by creating a **simple, natural self-introduction** and then a few **sample answers** you can use in a **club PI (personal interview)** or when meeting new people.
You can tweak them later to match your real personality — the idea is to *sound like yourself, just a calmer, more confident version.*

---

## 🪞 Step 1: Your Self-Introduction (base script)

When you walk into a PI or club room, they usually say:

> “Tell us about yourself.”

You can use this structure 👇

---

### 🌟 Example:

> “Good evening! I’m [Your Name], a first-year student from Metallurgical and Materials Engineering.
> I’m originally from [Your City/State].
> I joined MME because I’m interested in how materials shape technology — from steel to semiconductors.
> I enjoy learning new things, and I’m looking to explore areas beyond academics, which is why I’m interested in joining this club — to improve my skills and meet new people.”

---

### 🧩 Why it works:

✅ It’s short (around 30–40 seconds)
✅ Sounds natural and calm
✅ Shows curiosity and willingness to learn
✅ Doesn’t require big achievements

You can practice this in front of a mirror or record yourself — just to get comfortable hearing your own voice.

---

## 🗣️ Step 2: Common PI Questions and How to Answer Them

Here are 5 common questions and example answers.
You can memorize the ideas, not the exact lines.

---

### **1️⃣ Why do you want to join this club?**

> “I want to step out of my comfort zone and learn to communicate better with people.
> I think being part of a club will help me gain teamwork experience and improve my confidence.”

👉 *Shows honesty and self-awareness — interviewers love that.*

---

### **2️⃣ What are your strengths?**

> “I’m sincere and willing to learn. I may take some time to open up, but once I’m comfortable, I work well with others and give my best to whatever I’m doing.”

👉 *Balances modesty and positivity.*

---

### **3️⃣ What are your weaknesses?**

> “I’m a bit shy when meeting new people, but I’ve started taking small steps to improve that — like participating in discussions and trying to talk to new classmates.”

👉 *Shows growth mindset — you acknowledge it and are working on it.*

---

### **4️⃣ What do you expect from this club?**

> “I want to learn how to work in a team, handle real-life situations, and contribute to events. I’m also excited to learn from seniors and make new friends.”

---

### **5️⃣ Do you have any questions for us?**

> “Yes — I’d love to know how a first-year student like me can start contributing if selected.”

👉 *Shows interest and initiative.*

## 💡 Step 3: Calming Yourself Before Entering the Room

If you feel that instinct stopping you before going in — try this small trick:

1. **Breathe in** slowly for 4 seconds.
2. **Hold for 2 seconds.**
3. **Breathe out** slowly for 4 seconds.
4. As you exhale, say silently: “I’m just going to talk. Nothing more.”

You don’t need to *convince yourself you’re confident*.
Just act like someone who’s *curious* — curiosity feels lighter than confidence.

---

## 🧘 Step 4: Mental Shift — You’re Not “Performing”

Remember:

* They *want* you to succeed.
* You’re *not being judged* like in an exam.
* You’re there to learn, not to prove yourself.

Even if you stammer, forget, or say something simple — it’s okay.
What matters is you **showed up**. That’s already something most people don’t do.

---

Would you like me to tailor this intro and answers specifically for **a type of club** you’re thinking of joining (like a technical, cultural, or social service club)?
That way, I can make the script sound more fitting to the environment you’ll face.
