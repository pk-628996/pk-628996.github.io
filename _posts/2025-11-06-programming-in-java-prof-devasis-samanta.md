# [NOC: Programming in Java (106105191)](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105191)  
**Institution:** IIT Kharagpur  
**Instructor:** Prof. Debasis Samanta  
**Platform:** NPTEL  

## Overview  
With the rapid growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), there is a growing need to build large, complex software systems that are platform-independent, internet-enabled, modifiable, secure, and robust. The object-oriented paradigm addresses many of these requirements, and the Java programming language has emerged as one of the most versatile and widely-used environments for building such systems.  
This course aims to cover essential topics in Java programming, equipping participants with the skills to meet current IT industry demands and to solve practical problems in their domain of study.
